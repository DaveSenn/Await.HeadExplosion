- `ICriticalNotifyCompletion` helps to implement the awaiter pattern
- `IsCompleted` and `void GetResult()` or `TResult GetResult()` still have to be added by convention
- `OnCompleted` has to flow the execution context while `OnUnsafeCompleted` doesn't have to but most of the impl do
- `OnUnsafeCompleted` can be called from partially trusted code
